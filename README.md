# Restaurant LangChain Application
This repository contains a Streamlit-based application for managing and enhancing restaurant operations using LangChain. The application leverages the power of LangChain to handle various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as order management, customer queries, and more, to improve efficiency and customer experience in a restaurant setting.



# What is LangChain?
LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications that involve processing and generating natural language. It provides a suite of tools and libraries designed to facilitate the development of applications that can understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LangChain is particularly useful for tasks such as text generation, conversational AI, information retrieval, and more.
